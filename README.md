# Learning Viz
A library for capturing the machine learning training process as an animated gif.  This library is for learning purposes - I built it to make the process of model 'tuning' more intuitive for those just starting to learn about machine learning and data science

## Examples

### KNN Classifier learning decision boundary between red and blue class

### Random Forest Classifier learning decision boundary between red and blue class

### Support Vector Machine iterating through ranges of C parameter
